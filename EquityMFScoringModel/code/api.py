"""
FastAPI service exposing the scored Equity mutual fund universe to the dashboard.

    GET  /api/funds    the whole scored universe + the metadata to render it
    GET  /api/status   cache/scheduler health, for ops and manual curl checks
    POST /api/refresh  force a refresh now (also the seam an external scheduler
                       would call if this ever moves to serverless hosting)
    GET  /api/health   liveness probe

Every response is served from cache_store's in-memory snapshot, so no request
ever waits on the upstream feeds. See cache_store for the fail-safe semantics and
scheduler for the daily refresh.

Configuration (EquityMFScoringModel/.env, gitignored -- see .env.example):

    APP_ENV              development | production            (default development)
    EXTRA_CORS_ORIGINS   comma-separated browser origins allowed to call this API
    REFRESH_TOKEN        shared secret for POST /api/refresh

Setting APP_ENV=production tightens two things that are only safe on a private
machine: the localhost CORS origins are dropped, and POST /api/refresh refuses
to serve without REFRESH_TOKEN configured instead of running unauthenticated.

Run locally:
    uvicorn api:app --reload --port 8000 --app-dir EquityMFScoringModel/code
